Search Page
========

The Search Page provides multiple ways to filter and query PRISM data and multiple formats to export the data.  Search results are present in list form on the page and can be clicked on to view the assocaited data report.  Alternatively, the related data resources of the item or a map showing its location can be viewed instead.

Clicking on the *Location Filter* initially will bring up the map and show all available data resources.  Additional features of the  *Location Filter* are discussed below.

**The search options below are additive and can be use singly or together to help refine the search.**

Popular Searches

Search bar
--------

The Search bar at the top of the page allows for entry of keywords and data attributes to filter search results.  The text entered needs to  match data fields associated with the data resources in PRISM.  Search suggestions with the associated data field (in parentheses) will auto-populate  These data fields are detailed on the `Data Types (Resources) <resources.html>`_ page.

Zooming into to a more specific area, clicking on the *Map Tools* button in the upper right of the map and then selecting *Limit search results to map extent* will filter the search results by those shown on the map.  Alternatively a polygon, line or point can be drawn on the map (by selecting the option in *Map Tools*) and buffered by a set distance to filter results by only those that fall within the defined buffer.

Time Filter
------------

Using the *Time Filter* allows one to filter data resources by dates associated with the resources. *8Observation Start Time*, *Survey Date*, *Media Date*, *STR Status Data* or *Sample Date* can all be searched for by setting the date qualifier to either *Before*, *On*, or *After* a selected date.
