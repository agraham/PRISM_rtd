Team Lead Data Review
=====================

The items below outline the easiest data flow to follow for the Team Lead to begin reviewing their data after uploading to PRISM.

*If a new option needs to be added to any of the dropdown lists talk with the Polaris Database Manager or Administrator*

1. Was a new team member(s) created?
---------------------------------

If a team member(s) was not available in the list of members and you created a new one (adding name and phone number), add the additional information to the entry for the new personnel.

- Go the *Search* page and in the *Search bar* at the top type in the new persons name
- When the search result shows up click on *Edit* under the entry
- On the *Edit form* add the team member's **Organization**, **Role**, **Email Address** and **Phone Number** if necessary
- If a new option needs to be added to any of the dropdown lists talk with the Polaris Database Manager or Administrator
- Click *Save* at the top (or *Discard* to start over)

2. Was a new Segment(s) created?
---------------------------------

If a new Segment(s) was created during the Survey add additional information to the new Segment entry.

- Go the *Search* page and in the *Search bar* at the top type in the new Segment ID
- When the search result shows up click on *Edit* under the entry
- On the *Edit form* add additional information if known

  * Leave the **Segment Length** blank, with will auto fill when the Segment is adjusted on the Map

- The straight line that shows on the *Map* is drawn between the *Start* and *End* points created in the field
- Use the cursor to click on and move the straight line to match the shoreline and create the Segment geometry

  * Only change the Start/End points if absolutely necessary as these come from the GPS points collected in the field and should be fairly accurate

- Click *Save* at the top (or *Discard* to start over)

3. Upload GPX track file as a Media item
-----------------------------------------

- Save the file with a new name following this convention:  **YYYY-MM-DD_TEAM-#.gpx**
- Create a new *Media* item for the GPX file

  * Click on *Resource Manager* and then *Media*
  * Upload the new GPX file
