Map Page
========

The map page allows for viewing SCAT and pre-SCAT data and data layers in web map.  Available data and layers are presented in the Overlays menu (discussed below).  These Overlays include data stored within the PRISM application (i.e. Observations, Media, etc.) and data layers served to the web map via external GIS servers.

Basemaps
----------

Basemap options can be selected by clicking on the Basemap selector in the lower left corner of the map.  Standard basemap options include:

- Satellite Imagery (provided via www.mapbox.com)
- Topographic Map (provided via www.mapbox.com)
- Open Street Map (provided via OSM)

Other basemaps may include response specific satellite or drone collected imagery.

Overlays
------------

Overlays are geographic data layers that can visualized on the map page.  Overlay options can be added/removed from the map using the Overlay selector in the lower left corner of the map.  Additional layers can be added using the Add Layer button.  

Geographic data stored within PRISM such as Segments, Surveys, Zones, Pits and Photos (Media) can be added as Overlays and selected to view the associated data and reports.

External layers served to PRISM via a GIS server can added to map as an Overlay to provide additional information and reference for viewing.
